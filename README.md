# -N-Queen-Problem-Using-Backtracking-Algorithm
The N-Queen Problem is the problem of placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that none of them attack one another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal).  More specifically, I am solving this problem with placing 8 queens on 8x8 chessboard.
